        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This cod piccata is lemony, bright, and fresh. The most challenging thing about this recipe is to avoid overcooking the cod, while making the tangy and delightful sauce. My trick is to brown only one side of the fish, and allow it to finish in the sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>
            1 1/2 pounds cod filets, in serving-sized pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            4 teaspoons all-purpose flour, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            1 large lemon, half thinly sliced, half reserved
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons thinly sliced shallot
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup dry white wine
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus a few sprigs for garnish (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Pat cod filets dry with paper towels and lightly season both sides with salt and pepper. Use a scant teaspoon of flour to very lightly dust one side of cod filets. See note.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. When butter stops bubbling, add cod filets, floured side down. Cook undisturbed, until a light brown color develops, about 3 minutes. Keeping the floured side up, carefully remove filets from skillet and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Cook lemon slices in the same skillet for 2 to 3 minutes, turning to cook evenly, and add shallots and capers. Cook about 1 minute more. </li>
        <li>Stir in white wine; cook about 1 minute, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in chicken broth and chopped parsley, and squeeze juice of reserved lemon half into the skillet; cook about 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Gently return filets to the skillet, floured side up. Cook in the sauce until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove to a serving plate, floured side up, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Remove about 1/4 cup of liquid from skillet; allow to cool slightly</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and stir until melted.</li>
        <li>Whisk cooled liquid and remaining flour together to make a smooth slurry. Stir slurry briskly into the skillet, and  cook until sauce is thickened and bubbly. Pour sauce over cod filets, and garnish with parsley sprigs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
